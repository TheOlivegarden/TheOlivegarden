<h1>@TheOlivegarden's Profile</h1>

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm @TheOlivegarden:

<h2>Skills</h2>
I have experience in various programming languages and technologies, including: <br>

Basically everything connected with frontend, have experience with React, Laravel, Bootstrap, Angular, ASP.NET, Blazor, jQuery. <br>
I worked a lot in C++ and C#, Python.
<h2>Current Focus</h2><br>
Trying to learn Rust, get into Web3 space a bit.

<h2>Projects</h2><br>
They are old, and were never finished because i forgot :(

<h3>Project1</h3> - Website(asp.net Razor pages): Project from work where i create an Employee Management Dashboard that can be used by the HR team for better control of employees, tasks, and general control of the companies resources.
<br><h3>Project2</h3> - Minigame collection: Its a series of minigames written in c# that are just for fun and some of its logic can be implemented in your own games. Its a project just for learning and doesn't have a practical future.
<br><h3>Project3</h3> - KratoSkating: Upcoming twitter bot that would have a lot of fun and interesting features. It would post memes on its own from reddit subs like r/dankmemes and can be called in comment section of a tweet to make a meme. Functionality would resemble something like @theMemesBot.
