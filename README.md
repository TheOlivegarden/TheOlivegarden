Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm @TheOlivegarden, and I'm on a journey to become a proficient developer. I have a diverse set of skills and a passion for learning. Currently, I'm diving into the world of C#, adding another programming language to my toolkit. Here's a little more about me and my interests:

<h2>About Me</h2> <br>

<h2>Skills</h2>
I have experience in various programming languages and technologies, including: <br>

HTML <br>
CSS<br>
JavaScript<br>
PHP<br>
Java<br>
C++<br>
WordPress<br>
Kotlin<br>

<h2>Current Focus</h2><br>
Right now, I'm focusing on mastering C# and expanding my knowledge of software development in the .NET ecosystem. I'm excited about building desktop applications, web services, and games using C#.

<h2>Projects</h2><br>
I'm constantly working on projects to improve my skills and contribute to the developer community. Some of my recent projects include:<br>

<h3>Project1</h3> - Website(asp.net Razor pages): Project from work where i create an Employee Management Dashboard that can be used by the HR team for better control of employees, tasks, and general control of the companies resources.
<br><h3>Project2</h3> - Minigame collection: Its a series of minigames written in c# that are just for fun and some of its logic can be implemented in your own games. Its a project just for learning and doesn't have a practical future.
<br><h3>Project3</h3> - KratoSkating: Upcoming twitter bot that would have a lot of fun and interesting features. It would post memes on its own from reddit subs like r/dankmemes and can be called in comment section of a tweet to make a meme. Functionality would resemble something like @theMemesBot.
